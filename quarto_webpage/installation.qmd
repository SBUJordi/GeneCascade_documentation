## System requirements

-   Linux OS (e.g., CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
-   Disk space: Approximately **~475GB** is required for GeneCascade, which includes the Apptainer image and all reference databases (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, UniProtKB/TrEMBL, GTDB). Please ensure adequate space before starting. The Apptainer image itself requires about 2GB.
-   For optimal performance, a system with **32 CPU cores** and **5GB of RAM per core (total 160GB RAM)** is recommended. The number of CPU cores can be freely adjusted but we recommend strongly to always assign **5GB or more** of RAM per core.

## Installation dependencies

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) (formerly Singularity): The installation script will check if Apptainer is installed and in your PATH. If not, you will be prompted to install it (see [Apptainer Installation Guide](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/quick_start.html#installation)).
-   ([Bash](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html) as command-line shell)
-   (Optional: [Conda/Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) for environment management)
-   All further software dependencies (like MMseqs2) are bundled within the GeneCascade Apptainer image (`sbujordi/genecascade_mmseqs2_r:latest` from Docker Hub, saved as `genecascade_mmseqs2_r_latest.sif`), which is automatically downloaded during installation. This approach enhances:
    1.  Ease of use: Simplified installation and execution.
    2.  Portability: Consistent performance across different computing environments.
    3.  Reproducibility: Ensures identical software environments.
    4.  Version control: Precise management of software versions.
    5.  Isolation: Minimizes conflicts with existing system libraries.

## Default installation (interactive)

For a standard installation using the interactive command-line utility, follow these steps:

Optional - Create and activate a conda environment for GeneCascade:

```bash
conda create -n GeneCascade_env
conda activate GeneCascade_env
```

Optional - Navigate to your GeneCascade conda environment directory (if you want to clone the repository there):

```bash
cd $CONDA_PREFIX
```

Clone the GeneCascade GitHub repository to your current working directory:

```bash
# Replace with the actual GeneCascade repository URL if different
git clone https://github.com/SBUJordi/GeneCascade.git
```

Navigate to the new GeneCascade directory:

```bash
cd GeneCascade
```

Make the main installation script executable:

```bash
chmod +x genecascade_installation.sh
```

Execute the installation script. This will launch an interactive menu to guide you through the installation options:

```bash
./genecascade_installation.sh
```

You will be presented with a menu similar to this:

```console
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - INSTALL: GeneCascade Installation Utility
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - INSTALL: --------------------------------
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - INSTALL: This script will guide you through setting up GeneCascade.
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - INSTALL: Default Apptainer Image Directory: /path/to/GeneCascade/apptainer_images
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - INSTALL: Default Database Directory:        /path/to/GeneCascade/databases
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - INSTALL: Ensure you have sufficient disk space (~475GB for all databases) and a stable internet connection.

Select an installation option: 
1) Full Installation (Apptainer Image + All Databases + Add to PATH)
2) Install/Update Apptainer Image Only
3) Install/Update All Databases Only
4) Add GeneCascade Scripts to PATH
5) Check System Requirements (Apptainer, Disk Space)
6) Quit Installation
```
The default Apptainer image directory will be `GeneCascade/apptainer_images` and the default database directory will be `GeneCascade/databases` relative to where you cloned the repository.

For a complete installation from scratch, choose option `1` ("Full Installation"). The installation duration will depend on your system and network speed.

## Updating your existing GeneCascade installation

GeneCascade's installation script facilitates updates:

-   **Software Scripts (GeneCascade code)**: To update the GeneCascade scripts themselves, navigate to your `GeneCascade` directory and use `git pull` to get the latest changes from the repository.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/GeneCascade # Your GeneCascade installation directory
    git pull
    ```
    After pulling changes, you might need to re-run `./genecascade_installation.sh` if the update involves changes to dependencies, PATH setup, or if new database/image versions are recommended.

-   **Apptainer Image**: Use option `2` ("Install/Update Apptainer Image Only") from the `./genecascade_installation.sh` menu. This will pull the `sbujordi/genecascade_mmseqs2_r:latest` image.

-   **Databases**: Use option `3` ("Install/Update All Databases Only") from the `./genecascade_installation.sh` menu. This will attempt to download/update UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, UniProtKB/TrEMBL, and GTDB.

**Important Note:** For major version releases of GeneCascade that introduce significant changes, a full re-evaluation of the installation process or following specific release notes might be necessary.

## CAVEATS

-   **PATH configuration:** The installation script (Option 4 or as part of Full Installation) attempts to modify your shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.profile`) to add the `GeneCascade/scripts` directory to your `PATH`. If it cannot find a common profile or if the directory is already in the PATH, it will inform you. It also adds the path to the current session. Ensure you open a new terminal session or source your shell profile after installation/update for PATH changes to take permanent effect.

-   **Installation of third-party databases:** GeneCascade downloads and installs UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, UniProtKB/TrEMBL, and GTDB using `mmseqs databases` via the Apptainer image.
    -   The script checks for sufficient disk space in the target database directory (`GeneCascade/databases`) before starting downloads.
    -   If a database appears to exist, you'll be prompted whether to re-download/update.
    -   Issues during download (network, server-side, local constraints) can occur. If a database download fails, the script will log an error but continue to attempt other database installations. You can retry failed database installations using Option 3 from the menu.
    -   Temporary download directories (`GeneCascade/databases/tmp_mmseqs_download_*`) are created and should be cleaned up automatically.

-   **Managing Apptainer images after updates:** When updating the Apptainer image (Option 2), if an image file (`genecascade_mmseqs2_r_latest.sif` in `GeneCascade/apptainer_images`) already exists, you will be prompted to overwrite. The script primarily manages one standard image name. If you manually pull images with different names or versions, you might need to manage them manually to save disk space. GeneCascade's database installation utilities will try to find the SIF image first by the standard name (`genecascade_mmseqs2_r_latest.sif`) and then by a pattern (`genecascade_mmseqs2_r*.sif`) within the `GeneCascade/apptainer_images` directory.
