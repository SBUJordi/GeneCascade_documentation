# AI Assistant Instructions: Adapting StrainCascade to GeneCascade_documentation

## 1. Project Goal

The primary objective is to adapt content from the existing "StrainCascade" project (a Quarto webpage, originally from GitHub) into a new project called "GeneCascade_documentation". This involves systematically updating scripts, documentation, and other materials.

## 2. Core Task: Template-Based Adaptation

When you are provided with scripts, text, code snippets, or any other information from the "StrainCascade" project, treat it as a **template and starting point**. Your main task is to modify this content to be accurate and appropriate for the "GeneCascade_documentation" project.

## 3. Key Modifications

*   **Name Replacement**:
    *   Identify all occurrences of "StrainCascade" (and related specific terms, if any) and replace them with "GeneCascade" (and its corresponding new terms).
    *   This includes project titles, repository names, specific tool names, and any thematic keywords.
    *   Pay attention to context to ensure the replacements are logical (e.g., `StrainCascade_tool` might become `GeneCascade_tool`).
*   **Script and Code Adaptation**:
    *   For installation scripts, build scripts, or code examples:
        *   Preserve the original logic, structure, and sequence of operations unless a change is explicitly requested.
        *   Update file paths, package names, dependencies, URLs, and any configuration parameters to match the "GeneCascade_documentation" project's structure and requirements.
        *   Ensure that commands and code are functional within the "GeneCascade" context.
*   **Content and Documentation**:
    *   For textual content (e.g., README files, usage guides, tutorials, explanations):
        *   Update all information to accurately reflect "GeneCascade".
        *   Ensure examples, instructions, and descriptions are relevant and correct for "GeneCascade".

## 4. Style and Tone Guidelines

*   **Consistency**: Maintain the overall style, logical flow, and conciseness of the original "StrainCascade" material.
*   **Clarity**: Use clear, simple, and professional language.
*   **Conciseness**: Be direct and to the point in explanations and generated content. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.

## 5. Operational Mode

*   **Step-by-Step**: We will work through the adaptation process incrementally, focusing on specific pieces of content in each interaction.
*   **Clarification**: If details specific to "GeneCascade" are ambiguous or not provided, please ask for clarification to ensure accuracy.

## Example

If I provide the following "StrainCascade" installation instruction:
`"Download the StrainCascade analysis package using: git clone https://github.com/user/StrainCascade.git"`

You should adapt it for "GeneCascade", for example:
`"Download the GeneCascade analysis package using: git clone https://github.com/user/GeneCascade.git"`
(Assuming the repository name changes analogously, or asking for the correct URL if unsure, while keeping the instruction format similar).
